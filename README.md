Microsoft Azure Cosmos DB offers a pretty easy to follow tutorial here at:

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/java/azure/spring-framework/configure-spring-boot-starter-java-app-with-cosmos-db?view=azure-java-stable

They provide instructions to create a free account to prevent any billing mishaps with a SpringBoot.

Almost no learning how Cosmos DB works is required as it works almost exactly like JPA, all you need to do is import Azure support dependency as instructions say.
